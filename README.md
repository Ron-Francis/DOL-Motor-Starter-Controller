# DOL-Motor-Starter-Controller

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DOL motor starter controller is a device which is used for remote controlling of DOL motor starters using your smartphone.
This electronic device can be integrated with the existing DOL starter circuitry without much alterations and thus making the traditional DOL starter remote operatable.

The device uses an Atmega328 core with an SIM800l GSM module for the processing and communication purpose.
The ATmega328 (arduino bootloader required) device is programmed using the arduino integrated developement enviroment. The additional libraries required are : 

SoftwareSerial.h

EEPROM.h

The device is designed into seperate PCB's plates for the ease of custimization.
The Circuit diagram and PCB designs used are given.
